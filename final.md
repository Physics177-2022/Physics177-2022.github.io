# Physics 177: Computational Physics
### Spring 2022


# Final project

### Overview

Our final project will be a short review of a method or topic in computational physics (or computational methods/data analysis/data visualization more broadly), along with a simple worked example in Python. It could be related to a research project that you're working on, or just a topic that you're interested in. If you're unsure about what to work on, feel free to ask for suggestions in the Slack.

The final should be a notebook document (similar in length to one of our shorter homework assignments, like homework 2) combining text and examples in Python, that
- Introduces a computational topic or method  
- Provides background: what kind of problem is this meant to solve?  
- Explains the topic/method: how does it work (in words and possibly in equations, as appropriate)?  
- Provides an example application: if the project is focused on a particular type of problem, where is this problem encountered? If it is focused on a method, in what situations is the method useful?  

Feel free to elaborate on and expand your midterm project for the final.   

### Due date

TBD

### Other notes

If you would like, feel free to collaborate with other students on the final. Each individual should write their own report, however.

The final will be assigned through GitHub classroom as with the homework assignments. There I'll provide a Jupyter notebook that summarizes the points above.
