# Physics 177: Computational Physics
### Spring 2022


# Midterm mini-project

### Overview

Our midterm will be a short literature review of a method or topic in computational physics (or computational methods/data analysis/data visualization more broadly). It could be related to a research project that you're working on, or just a topic that you're interested in. If you're unsure about what to work on, feel free to ask for suggestions in the Slack. You can think about the midterm as a warmup for the final project.

The midterm should be a short report, around one page (~500 words -- less is okay as long as it makes the main points below) in length, that
- Introduces a computational topic or method  
- Provides background: what kind of problem is this meant to solve?  
- Explains the topic/method: how does it work (in words and possibly in equations, as appropriate)?  
- Gives an example application: if the project is focused on a particular type of problem, where is this problem encountered? If it is focused on a method, in what situations is the method useful?  

The midterm need not contain any code (but could point to a final project that involves some coding!), or a fully worked example.   

### Due date

TBD

### Other notes

If you would like, feel free to collaborate with other students on the midterm. Each individual should write their own report, however.

The midterm will be assigned through GitHub classroom as with the homework assignments. There I'll provide a Jupyter notebook that summarizes the points above.
